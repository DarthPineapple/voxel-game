# Voxel Game README

## Project Overview
This project is an efficient block-based voxel game that utilizes cubic chunks and dynamic chunk loading. The graphics are rendered using Vulkan, providing high performance and flexibility.

## Features
- Block-based voxel world
- Cubic chunk management
- Dynamic loading and unloading of chunks
- Vulkan graphics rendering

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- Vulkan SDK
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)

## Step-by-Step Checklist

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd voxel-game
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the Vulkan SDK installed. Follow the instructions on the official Vulkan website for your operating system.

### 3. Build the Project
Navigate to the project directory and create a build directory:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
Run CMake to configure the project:
```
cmake ..
```
Compile the project:
```
cmake --build .
```

### 4. Run the Application
After building the project, you can run the application:
```
./voxel-game
```

### 5. Modify and Extend
You can modify the game by editing the following files:
- **src/world/chunk.cpp** and **src/world/chunk.h**: Modify chunk behavior.
- **src/world/voxel.cpp** and **src/world/voxel.h**: Change voxel properties.
- **src/graphics/renderer.cpp** and **src/graphics/renderer.h**: Adjust rendering logic.

### 6. Add Assets
To add new textures or shaders, place them in the `assets/textures` or `assets/shaders` directories, respectively. Update the rendering code to utilize these assets.

### 7. Contribute
If you would like to contribute to the project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
